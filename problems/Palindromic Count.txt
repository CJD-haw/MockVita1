Palindromic Count

Problem Description
Given a string Str, and a set of numbers (S) which determine the length of palindromic substrings contained within Str, find out the count of all such palindromes.

Constraints
0 < N <= 10 ^ 4
0 < M <= 10 ^ 4

Input
First line contains an integer N which is length of string
Second line contains a string of length N containing all lowercase characters
Third line contains an integer M which is the number of elements in set S
Fourth line contains M space separated integers which correspond to lengths of palindromic substrings that must be found within Str

Output
Count of all palindromic substrings which are of lengths corresponding to number in set S
